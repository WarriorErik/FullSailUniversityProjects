# FullSailUniversityProjects
These files contain a majority of all the projects I have built while at school. the files consist of the languages I used, ranging from c++, c#, python, Java, and sql. With Java, however, I am currently working on a private repo, which I cannot share,  for Echelon Fitness, a software company based in Florida. However, Java is my favorite and most proficient  language. Also, and most importantly, these are all zip files for download. All of my separate repositories show these projects as well.
